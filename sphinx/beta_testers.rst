Beta Testers Guide
======================

Thank You!
----------
Thank you for taking some time out of your day to help me test Polo. It
means a lot. On this page you will find info on how to get started, 
where to find test data, what to do with it and how to report any bugs that
you find.


Getting Polo Beta Version
-----------------------------

Visit the :ref:`Installation Guide` to learn more about getting the latest
Polo release for your system. For test releases test data will be packaged
along with the installer to help you start using Polo. You also might want to 
skim over the :ref:`Background` section of the About page to get a better idea
of what Polo's use cases are. The :ref:`User's Guide` goes into more detail
about the specific functions of each tool included in Polo. 

Test Data
----------------

If you do not have any screening data of your own that is not a problem.
You can visit the `Test Data release page <https://github.com/Hauptman-Woodward/Marco_Polo/releases/tag/test-data>`_
at the Polo GitHub repository and download the files there.

What Now?
---------------------------

Now that you have got some data you can start working with it. Here is a list
of things to do with your data and links to sections of the documentation
on how to do it.

- Open the xtal file: :ref:`Importing Images from a Directory`
- Open the folder of images and classify them: :ref:`Importing a Saved Run`
- Classify images using the Slideshow Viewer: :ref:`Using the Slideshow View`
- Classify images using the Plate Viewer: :ref:`Using the Plate Viewer`
- Create an optimization screen: :ref:`Using the Optimize Tool`
- Do something unexpected in an attempt to break the program (**Highly Recommended!**)
