How do I install Polo?
-----------------------

Please visit the installation guide, :ref:`Installation`. Polo is available for
Windows 10, Mac and Ubuntu.

I did not do my crystal screening at HWI, can I still use Polo?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, definitely! Although some functionality of Polo will be limited, mostly due
to the fact we cannot anticipate how metadata for your images (cocktail formulations,
sample info, etc.) is formatted. The good news is you will still be able to classify
your images using the MARCO model, export your classifications to text files,
create PowerPoint presentations and use all of the image viewing interfaces.

On that note though if you would like to have more out of the box compatibility
with your screening images please feel free to write your own
code to do so and add a pull request. We are very interested in building functionality
for as many people as possible and working towards standardizing data management 
and file formats for high throughput crystallography. If adding your own code
is not realistic, or just when in doubt feel free to reach out to 
`Ethan Holleman <https://github.com/EthanHolleman>`_.

Polo isn't working on my machine, what can I do?
------------------------------------------------

If you haven't already please visit :ref:`Issues Others have Encountered` and see
if anything looks familiar. Also if nothing does and you are able to
solve your issue please let us know so we can document the problem, improve
Polo and help other users. If you are unable to fix the problem feel free to
open an issue on the `Polo GitHub page <https://github.com/EthanHolleman>`_ or
contact `Ethan Holleman <https://github.com/EthanHolleman>`_. Please include a
detailed description of your problem and screenshots of any error messages.

My question isn't here, how can I get it answered?
