Beta Testers Guide
======================

Thank You!
----------
Thank you for taking some time out of your day to help me test Polo. It
means a lot. On this page you will find info on how to get started, 
where to find test data, what to do with it and how to report any bugs that
you find.


Getting Polo Beta Version
-----------------------------

Visit the Downloads page to see all current releases. Download the most
current one for your operating system. You also might want to skim over
the About page to get a better idea of what Polo's use cases are.


Test Data
--------------------------
Test images are available for download from the
`SourceForge page here  <https://sourceforge.net/projects/marco-polo/files/test_data/>`_.
Ideally you should download one file from the *file* from the xtal_files folder
and one *folder* from the test_images folder. The difference between the two
formats is xtal is a file format used by Polo to store images, annotations,
and classifications all in one place while the folder is more similar to
what a new user would download directly from HWI's FTP server when their
screening images are available.

Once you have the test data downloaded and Polo installed on your machine
you are ready to start testing. The next section will outline a couple of
basic tasks to get you started.


What Now?
