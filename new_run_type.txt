# What you need to do
# Due to the nubmer of variable inputs things are a little complicated

# 1. Create a new Run class by subclassing the Run class. Overwrite
# the classmethod init_from_directory this. Creating a new run class
# will make the RunImporter aware of it and set the import priority. Since
# when reading a directory the importer does not know what kind of run it
# is reading it attempts to important runs as object until it finds one that
# works. Setting a higher run proiorty means that run type is attempted earler
# meaning so metadata is not lost. 

# If have cocktail then will need more stuff to do
# Need to overwrite 2 main options. It may be the case where only one verion
# of cocktails was used and is included in the image directory
# if that is the case overwrite the Menu and cocktail reader class
# to read your specific kind of cocktail file and read that in during the
# creation of your class

# other option is to include cocktail files in the Polo distribution and
# create a bartender class that curates them This bartender will be created
# in the init file and then be available for import and use with your class
# This will require creating new Cocktail reader classes
